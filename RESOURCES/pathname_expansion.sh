# Pathname Expansion (Globbing) in Bash/Shell

## Definition  
**Pathname expansion** (or **globbing**) is a shell mechanism where wildcard characters (e.g., `*`, `?`, `[]`) are used to match file/directory names. The shell replaces these patterns with actual matching paths **before executing a command**.

---

## Key Wildcards and Examples

### 1. `*` (Asterisk)  
- Matches **any number of characters** (including zero).  
- **Example**:  
  ```bash
  ls *.txt    # Lists all files ending with .txt (e.g., file1.txt, notes.txt)
2. ? (Question Mark)
Matches exactly one character.

Example:

bash
ls file?.txt  # Matches file1.txt, fileA.txt, but NOT file10.txt
3. [] (Square Brackets)
Matches one character from a set or range.

Examples:

bash
ls file[1-3].txt  # Matches file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt
ls [aeiou]*       # Lists files starting with a vowel
4. [!...] or [^...] (Negation)
Matches any character NOT in the set.

Example:

bash
ls file[!2].txt   # Matches file1.txt, file3.txt, etc., but NOT file2.txt
Important Notes
Hidden Files:
Wildcards like * do not match hidden files (starting with .) by default. To include them:

bash
ls .*       # Lists hidden files (including . and ..)
ls .[!.]*   # Lists hidden files excluding . and ..
No Matches Found:
If no files match the pattern, the shell leaves the pattern unchanged:

bash
echo *.txt   # Outputs "*.txt" if no .txt files exist
Quoting to Disable Expansion:
Use quotes to prevent expansion:

bash
echo "*.txt"   # Outputs *.txt (literal string)
Globbing vs. Regex:
Globbing is simpler and file-focused (e.g., * vs. regex .*).

Order of Expansion
Expansion occurs in a specific sequence. For example:

bash
echo {a,b}*.txt  # Brace expansion ‚Üí a*.txt b*.txt, then pathname expansion
Use Cases
Bulk file operations: mv *.png images/

Pattern-based cleanup: rm backup-2023-??-??

Filtering files: cp *[0-9].log logs/
